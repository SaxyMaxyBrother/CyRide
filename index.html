      <h2>CyRide runs 7 days a week — but weekends lag behind.</h2>
      <p>
        CyRide is the city bus system for Ames, operated in partnership with Iowa State University and ISU Student Government.
        It runs <strong>13 fixed routes</strong> plus Dial-A-Ride and the late-night Moonlight Express. On paper, it’s a seven-day system —
        but in practice, weekend service is significantly more limited in both routes and frequency.

      <h2>Why Weekend CyRide Service Needs to Improve</h2>
      <div class="argument-grid">
        <article class="argument-card">
          <h3>1. Student life is weekend-heavy</h3>
          <p>
            Classes may taper off Friday afternoon, but student life at Iowa State becomes
            busiest on Friday nights and weekends — from games and residence hall events
            to late-night studying, jobs, and social life.
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              Many campus and community activities — athletic events, club meetings,
              concerts, and trips to essential places like grocery stores — happen on Saturdays and Sundays.
              When buses are less frequent or skip certain corridors, students without cars face long waits,
              limited choices, or expensive rideshares.
            </p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="argument-card">
          <h3>2. Weekend routes & frequency are limited</h3>
          <p>
            During the school year, CyRide’s full network includes <strong>13 fixed routes</strong>, but only a subset of these run on weekends.
            Weekend schedules group service into fewer routes with longer gaps between buses.
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              On typical school-year Saturdays, service focuses on routes like #1 Red (East & West),
              #2 Green (East & West), #3 Blue, #5 Yellow, #6 Brown (North & South), #9 Plum, and #11 Cherry.
              On Sundays, service is even narrower — for example, Sunday schedules often look similar
              but without #5 Yellow. That means fewer options for reaching off-campus apartments,
              jobs, and stores on weekends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fewer routes and longer headways mean some parts of Ames are effectively “cut off” compared
              to the robust weekday network.
            </p>
          </div>

        <article class="argument-card">
          <h3>3. Safety depends on more than Moonlight Express</h3>
          <p>
            Moonlight Express is CyRide’s free late-night service that runs <strong>Friday and Saturday nights
            from about 10:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.</strong> when ISU is in full session. It’s designed to give
            students a safe ride home.
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              Moonlight Express is an amazing safety resource — especially after downtown or Campustown events.
              But outside that time window, students traveling on weekend mornings, afternoons,
              or early evenings still face gaps in service. Better daytime and evening weekend service
              would complement Moonlight Express and keep more students out of unsafe situations.
            </p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="argument-card">
          <h3>4. High ridership justifies better weekends</h3>
          <p>
            CyRide provided roughly <strong>4.7 million rides in FY 2024</strong>, making it one of the most heavily used
            transit systems in Iowa when measured per resident in its service area.
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              As ridership rebounds after the pandemic, demand is again concentrated around Iowa State.
              Students, staff, and community members increasingly rely on CyRide not just for commuting,
              but for everything from work to healthcare to groceries. Improving weekend service is not
              a luxury — it matches how people actually move around Ames.

    <!-- SIMPLE VISUAL COMPARISON -->
    <section id="evidence" class="content-section">
      <h2>Visualizing Weekend vs Weekday CyRide</h2>
      <p>
        CyRide’s fixed-route network includes <strong>13 routes</strong>, but the number running on a typical school-year
        weekend is smaller. The chart below compares how many fixed routes are available on a typical
        weekday vs. Saturday vs. Sunday (grouping variants of a route together).
      </p>

      <div class="chart">
        <div class="chart-row">
          <span class="chart-label">Weekdays (school-year)</span>
          <div class="chart-bar" data-value="13"></div>
          <span class="chart-value">13 routes</span>
        </div>
        <div class="chart-row">
          <span class="chart-label">Saturday</span>
          <div class="chart-bar" data-value="10"></div>
          <span class="chart-value">~10 routes</span>
        </div>
        <div class="chart-row">
          <span class="chart-label">Sunday</span>
          <div class="chart-bar" data-value="9"></div>
          <span class="chart-value">~9 routes</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="chart-footnote">
        <p>
          These counts are based on CyRide’s published school-year route lists. Directional variants of
          a route (like #1 Red East/West and #2 Green East/West) are counted together as a single route.

          <h3>Group Projects Off-Campus</h3>
          <p>
            A group project meets at a teammate’s apartment off Lincoln Way on Sunday afternoon.
            With fewer routes and less frequent service, some group members have to leave
            over an hour early or depend on friends with cars just to make it on time.

        <article class="story-card">
          <h3>Weekend Jobs & Shifts</h3>
          <p>
            Many students work retail, food-service, or campus jobs that include weekend shifts.
            When buses run less often, a missed connection means being late to work,
            and rideshares can eat a big chunk of a student paycheck.

        </article>
        <article class="story-card">
          <h3>Groceries & Basic Needs</h3>
          <p>
            Students without cars use CyRide to access grocery stores, pharmacies, and other essentials.
            Weekend gaps can force them to delay basic needs or carry heavy bags long distances from
            the nearest stop that actually has weekend service.

        </article>
        <article class="story-card">
          <h3>Late-Night Safety</h3>
          <p>
            Moonlight Express helps students get home safely late at night on Fridays and Saturdays,
            but its limited hours still leave some travel times uncovered. For students staying late
            at friends’ apartments, at the library, or at events off-campus, more frequent weekend routes
            and slightly extended hours could make a big difference.
