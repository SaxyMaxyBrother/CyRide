      <h2>CyRide runs 7 days a week — but weekends lag behind.</h2>
      <p>
        CyRide is the city bus system for Ames, operated in partnership with Iowa State University and ISU Student Government.
        It runs <strong>13 fixed routes</strong> plus Dial-A-Ride and the late-night Moonlight Express. On paper, it’s a seven-day system —
        but in practice, weekend service is significantly more limited in both routes and frequency.

      <h2>Why Weekend CyRide Service Needs to Improve</h2>

          <h3>1. Student life is weekend-heavy</h3>
          <p>
            Classes may taper off Friday afternoon, but student life at Iowa State becomes
            busiest on Friday nights and weekends — from games and residence hall events
            to late-night studying, jobs, and social life.
          </p>

            <p>
              Many campus and community activities — athletic events, club meetings,
              concerts, and trips to essential places like grocery stores — happen on Saturdays and Sundays.
              When buses are less frequent or skip certain corridors, students without cars face long waits,
              limited choices, or expensive rideshares.
            </p>

        <article class="argument-card">
          <h3>2. Weekend routes & frequency are limited</h3>
          <p>
            During the school year, CyRide’s full network includes <strong>13 fixed routes</strong>, but only a subset of these run on weekends.
            Weekend schedules group service into fewer routes with longer gaps between buses.
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              On typical school-year Saturdays, service focuses on routes like #1 Red (East & West),
              #2 Green (East & West), #3 Blue, #5 Yellow, #6 Brown (North & South), #9 Plum, and #11 Cherry.
              On Sundays, service is even narrower — for example, Sunday schedules often look similar
              but without #5 Yellow. That means fewer options for reaching off-campus apartments,
              jobs, and stores on weekends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fewer routes and longer headways mean some parts of Ames are effectively “cut off” compared
              to the robust weekday network.

          <h3>3. Safety depends on more than Moonlight Express</h3>
          <p>
            Moonlight Express is CyRide’s free late-night service that runs <strong>Friday and Saturday nights
            from about 10:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.</strong> when ISU is in full session. It’s designed to give
            students a safe ride home.
