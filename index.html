      <h2>Why Weekend CyRide Service Needs to Improve</h2>
      <div class="argument-grid">
        <article class="argument-card">
          <h3>1. Student life is weekend-heavy</h3>
          <p>
            Classes may taper off Friday afternoon, but student life at Iowa State becomes
            busiest on Friday nights and weekends — from late-night studying and group projects
            to jobs, games, residence hall events, and social life.
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              Many campus and community events — athletic games, club meetings, concerts,
              and trips to essential places like grocery stores — happen on Saturdays and Sundays.
              When buses are less frequent or skip certain corridors, students without cars face
              long waits or expensive rideshares.
            </p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="argument-card">
          <h3>2. Weekend routes & frequency are limited</h3>
          <p>
            CyRide’s school-year schedule includes weekday, Saturday, Sunday, and Moonlight
            Express services. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
            But the list of weekend routes is noticeably shorter.
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              On Saturdays, 10 routes operate (#1 Red East/West, #2 Green East/West,
              #3 Blue, #5 Yellow, #6 Brown North/South, #9 Plum, #11 Cherry). On Sundays,
              service drops to 9 routes, with #5 Yellow not running. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
              Other routes like #7 Purple, #12 Lilac, and #21 Cardinal are more limited or
              do not run under some reduced schedules. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
            </p>
            <p>
              Fewer routes and longer headways mean some apartments, jobs, and stores become
              much harder to reach on weekends.
            </p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="argument-card">
          <h3>3. Safety depends on more than Moonlight Express</h3>
          <p>
            Moonlight Express offers free late-night rides within Ames on Friday and Saturday
            nights from about 10:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. when ISU is in session. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              This is an incredible service for late-night safety — especially after social
              events and downtown activities. But outside that time window, students traveling
              on weekend mornings, afternoons, or early evenings still face long waits or
              gaps in coverage. Better daytime and evening service complements Moonlight
              Express and keeps more students off the road.
            </p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="argument-card">
          <h3>4. Ridership is high enough to justify better weekends</h3>
          <p>
            CyRide’s fixed-route ridership was over 4.7 million trips in 2024, up nearly 14%
            from 2023 as riders return after the pandemic. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              That level of demand suggests that improving weekend access isn’t a luxury —
              it’s a response to how often students, staff, and community members already
              rely on the bus. With so many riders connected to ISU, making weekend service
              stronger directly supports student success and equity.

    <!-- SIMPLE VISUAL COMPARISON -->
    <section id="evidence" class="content-section">
      <h2>Visualizing Weekend vs Weekday CyRide</h2>
      <p>
        CyRide operates 13 fixed routes overall, plus Dial-A-Ride and Moonlight Express. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
        But weekend service uses only a subset of those routes. The chart below compares how
        many fixed routes are available on a typical school-year weekday vs. Saturday vs. Sunday.

          <h3>Group Projects Off-Campus</h3>
          <p>
            A group project meets at a teammate’s apartment off Lincoln Way on Sunday afternoon.
            With fewer routes and less frequent service, some group members have to leave
            over an hour early or rely on friends with cars.

        <article class="story-card">
          <h3>Weekend Jobs & Shifts</h3>
          <p>
            Many students work retail, food service, or campus jobs that include weekend shifts.
            When buses run less often, a missed connection means being late to work or needing
            an expensive rideshare.

        <article class="story-card">
          <h3>Groceries & Basic Needs</h3>
          <p>
            Students without cars depend on CyRide to buy groceries, pick up prescriptions,
            and run errands. Weekend gaps can mean putting off basic needs or carrying heavy
            bags long distances from the nearest stop that does have service.

          <h3>Late-Night Safety</h3>
          <p>
            Moonlight Express is a critical safety service, but its hours (about 10:30 p.m.–2:30 a.m.)
            don’t help when someone is stuck at a friend’s place at 3 a.m. or needs to get home
            from a late study session that runs past normal routes but before Moonlight starts. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
