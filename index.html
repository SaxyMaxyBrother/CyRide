      <h2>CyRide runs seven days a week. Weekends shouldn’t feel like an afterthought.</h2>
      <p>
        On weekdays, buses feel constant and reliable. On weekends, routes shrink, waits stretch past 30–40 minutes,
        and students without cars are the first ones stranded. This site argues for stronger weekend service so
        student life, jobs, and safety don’t pause after Friday night.

      <h2>What’s Broken on Weekends?</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        When buses thin out on Saturdays and Sundays, it quietly decides who gets to participate fully in campus life
        and who has to stay home. These four issues show why weekend service needs an update.
      </p>

      <div class="argument-grid">
        <article class="argument-card hover-lift">
          <h3>1. Long waits</h3>
          <p class="argument-punch">
            A 10-minute ride shouldn’t require a 45-minute wait.
          </p>
          <button class="toggle-details">Show more</button>
          <div class="details">
            <p>
              On many corridors, weekday buses come often enough that missing one isn’t a crisis. On weekends, the same
              stops can go quiet for half an hour or longer. For students who work, study, or run errands without a car,
              one missed bus can mean being late to a shift or skipping plans entirely.
            </p>

        <article class="argument-card hover-lift">
          <h3>2. Fewer routes</h3>
          <p class="argument-punch">
            Some apartments might as well disappear on Sundays.

          <div class="details">
            <p>
              Weekend schedules cut back on which routes run. That means some apartment complexes, jobs, and stores lose
              direct service or only get a bus every once in a while. The parts of Ames where students already rely on
              transit the most become harder to reach right when they finally have time to use them.

          <h3>3. Safety gaps</h3>
          <p class="argument-punch">
            “Just Uber home” isn’t a safety plan.

              Moonlight Express is a huge step toward safer late-night travel, but it doesn’t cover every time students
              are out. Study groups, campus jobs, and social events often end right as regular buses stop but before
              Moonlight starts. A stronger weekend schedule would support safety before things become an emergency.

          <h3>4. Equity & access</h3>
          <p class="argument-punch">
            Weekends shouldn’t reward “who owns a car.”

            <p>
              Students who don’t have cars, don’t want to drive late, or share a vehicle with family are hit hardest by
              thin weekend service. When buses slow down, participation in jobs, clubs, and community events becomes a
              privilege tied to money and transportation, not effort or interest.

            A group for an engineering project meets at a teammate’s off-campus apartment Sunday night. Two members without
            cars leave the meeting early to catch the last bus. They miss part of the planning conversation and end up
            doing extra work later just to keep up.

            After a residence hall event, Taylor and their friends realize the bus they counted on doesn’t run this late
            on weekends. They split an expensive rideshare home because walking across town at midnight doesn’t feel safe.
            The next time, they decide not to go at all.
